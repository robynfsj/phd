Worksheet,Details
samples,Sample numbers (for own reference).
mass,The amount of sediment used when creating the diatom slide (g).
microspheres,The number of microspheres counted per sample.
counts,"The number of each taxon counted per sample.
P. ocellata not split up into size or ocelli number."
p_oc_breakdown,"Breakdown of P. ocellata counts by size and ocelli number.
For each variable, the first number is the number of ocelli. The range is the diameter (Âµm). U stands for undetermined and was assigned to valves that were too dissolved or broken to be assigned a size class."
p_oc_pres,"Preservation of P. ocellata valves (counts of valves that were whole, dissolving or were so dissolved that only the centre remained)."
f_index,Preservation of all valves (counts of all valves that were whole and all that were dissolved and/or fragmented).
taxa,"A list of all the taxa counted in the samples and their lifestyle (planktonic, facultative planktonic, benthic)."
NA,NA
Non-diatom data,NA
pollen,"Depth (m), arboreal pollen (%) and arboreal pollen minus Pinus and Juniperus (%). Note data is not the most up to data version as published in Roucoux et al. 2008."
sedimentology,"Loss on ignition (LOI) data. Depth (m), LOI (%) and CO3(%)."
NA,NA
Appended after R analysis,NA
zone_boundaries,Depth (m) of diatom assemblage zone boundaries.
zones,NA
