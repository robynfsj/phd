# PhD data analysis and presentation: Lake Ioannina diatom record spanning MIS 7–9

This repository contains the R scripts for the data analysis of the first chapter of my PhD.  Data and visualisations can't 
be included here until they have been published.  
  
Scripts:  
[01-load.R](https://github.com/robynfsj/phd-ioannina-long-record/blob/master/scripts/01-load.R) – reads in the data from an 
Excel spreadsheet  
[02-manipulate.R](https://github.com/robynfsj/phd-ioannina-long-record/blob/master/scripts/02-manipulate.R) – extensive 
manipulation of the data to make it suitable for analysis  
[03-zonation.R](https://github.com/robynfsj/phd-ioannina-long-record/blob/master/scripts/03-zonation.R) – constrained 
incremental sum of squares (CONISS) cluster analysis to group similar adjacent samples together to form diatom assemblage zones  
[04-ordination.R](https://github.com/robynfsj/phd-ioannina-long-record/blob/master/scripts/04-ordination.R) – dimensionality 
reduction of the multivariate data to pick out the main trends  
[05-strat-plot.R](https://github.com/robynfsj/phd-ioannina-long-record/blob/master/scripts/05-strat-plot.R) – plots the 
stratigraphic diagram  
  
The following pages document some of my thought processes:  
[Exploring zonation options](https://robynfsj.github.io/phd-ioannina-long-record/exploring-zonation-options.html)  
[Plotting dendrograms](https://robynfsj.github.io/phd-ioannina-long-record/plotting-dendrograms.html)
